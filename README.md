**Fugue is a unified interface for distributed computing that lets users execute Python, Pandas, and SQL code on Spark, Dask, and Ray with minimal rewrites**.

Fugue is most commonly used for:

*   **Parallelizing or scaling existing Python and Pandas code** by bringing it to Spark, Dask, or Ray with minimal rewrites.
*   Using [FugueSQL](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/quick_look/ten_minutes_sql.html) to **define end-to-end workflows** on top of Pandas, Spark, and Dask DataFrames. FugueSQL is an enhanced SQL interface that can invoke Python code.

## [Fugue API](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/quick_look/ten_minutes.html)

The Fugue API is a collection of functions that are capable of running on Pandas, Spark, Dask, and Ray. The simplest way to use Fugue is the [`transform()` function](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/beginner/transform.html). This lets users parallelize the execution of a single function by bringing it to Spark, Dask, or Ray. In the example below, the `map_letter_to_food()` function takes in a mapping and applies it on a column. This is just Pandas and Python so far (without Fugue).

```python
import pandas as pd
from typing import Dict

input_df = pd.DataFrame({"id":[0,1,2], "value": (["A", "B", "C"])})
map_dict = {"A": "Apple", "B": "Banana", "C": "Carrot"}

def map_letter_to_food(df: pd.DataFrame, mapping: Dict[str, str]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df["value"] = df["value"].map(mapping)
    return df
```

Now, the `map_letter_to_food()` function is brought to the Spark execution engine by invoking the `transform()` function of Fugue. The output `schema` and `params` are passed to the `transform()` call. The `schema` is needed because it's a requirement for distributed frameworks. A schema of `"*"` below means all input columns are in the output.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from fugue import transform

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
sdf = spark.createDataFrame(input_df)

out = transform(sdf,
               map_letter_to_food,
               schema="*",
               params=dict(mapping=map_dict),
               )
# out is a Spark DataFrame
out.show()
```
```rst
+---+------+
| id| value|
+---+------+
|  0| Apple|
|  1|Banana|
|  2|Carrot|
+---+------+
```

<details>
  <summary>PySpark equivalent of Fugue transform()</summary>

  ```python
from typing import Iterator, Union
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType
from pyspark.sql import DataFrame, SparkSession

spark_session = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

def mapping_wrapper(dfs: Iterator[pd.DataFrame], mapping):
    for df in dfs:
        yield map_letter_to_food(df, mapping)

def run_map_letter_to_food(input_df: Union[DataFrame, pd.DataFrame], mapping):
    # conversion
    if isinstance(input_df, pd.DataFrame):
        sdf = spark_session.createDataFrame(input_df.copy())
    else:
        sdf = input_df.copy()

    schema = StructType(list(sdf.schema.fields))
    return sdf.mapInPandas(lambda dfs: mapping_wrapper(dfs, mapping),
                            schema=schema)

result = run_map_letter_to_food(input_df, map_dict)
result.show()
  ```
</details>

This syntax is simpler, cleaner, and more maintainable than the PySpark equivalent. At the same time, no edits were made to the original Pandas-based function to bring it to Spark. It is still usable on Pandas DataFrames. Fugue `transform()` also supports Dask and Ray as execution engines alongside the default Pandas-based engine.

The Fugue API has a broader collection of functions that are also compatible with Spark, Dask, and Ray. For example, we can use `load()` and `save()` to create an end-to-end workflow compatible with Spark, Dask, and Ray. For the full list of functions, see the [Top Level API](https://fugue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/top_api.html)

```python
import fugue.api as fa

def run(engine=None):
    with fa.engine_context(engine):
        df = fa.load("/path/to/file.parquet")
        out = fa.transform(df, map_letter_to_food, schema="*")
        fa.save(out, "/path/to/output_file.parquet")

run()                 # runs on Pandas
run(engine="spark")   # runs on Spark
run(engine="dask")    # runs on Dask
```

All functions underneath the context will run on the specified backend. This makes it easy to toggle between local execution, and distributed execution.

## [FugueSQL](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/fugue_sql/index.html)

FugueSQL is a SQL-based language capable of expressing end-to-end data workflows on top of Pandas, Spark, and Dask. The `map_letter_to_food()` function above is used in the SQL expression below. This is how to use a Python-defined function along with the standard SQL `SELECT` statement.

```python
from fugue.api import fugue_sql
import json

query = """
    SELECT id, value
      FROM input_df
    TRANSFORM USING map_letter_to_food(mapping={{mapping}}) SCHEMA *
    """
map_dict_str = json.dumps(map_dict)

# returns Pandas DataFrame
fugue_sql(query,mapping=map_dict_str)

# returns Spark DataFrame
fugue_sql(query, mapping=map_dict_str, engine="spark")
```

## Installation

Fugue can be installed through pip or conda. For example:

```bash
pip install fugue
```

It also has the following installation extras:

*   **spark**: to support Spark as the [ExecutionEngine](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/advanced/execution_engine.html)
*   **dask**: to support Dask as the ExecutionEngine.
*   **ray**: to support Ray as the ExecutionEngine.
*   **duckdb**: to support DuckDB as the ExecutionEngine, read [details](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/integrations/backends/duckdb.html).
*   **polars**: to support Polars DataFrames and extensions using Polars.
*   **ibis**: to enable Ibis for Fugue workflows, read [details](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/integrations/backends/ibis.html).
*   **cpp_sql_parser**: to enable the CPP antlr parser for Fugue SQL. It can be 50+ times faster than the pure Python parser. For the main Python versions and platforms, there is already pre-built binaries, but for the remaining, it needs a C++ compiler to build on the fly.

For example a common use case is:

```bash
pip install "fugue[duckdb,spark]"
```

Note if you already installed Spark or DuckDB independently, Fugue is able to automatically use them without installing the extras.

## [Getting Started](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/)

The best way to get started with Fugue is to work through the 10 minute tutorials:

*   [Fugue API in 10 minutes](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/quick_look/ten_minutes.html)
*   [FugueSQL in 10 minutes](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/tutorials/quick_look/ten_minutes_sql.html)

For the top level API, see:

*   [Fugue Top Level API](https://fugue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/top_api.html)

The [tutorials](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/) can also be run in an interactive notebook environment through binder or Docker:

### Using binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fugue-project/tutorials/master)

**Note it runs slow on binder** because the machine on binder isn't powerful enough for a distributed framework such as Spark. Parallel executions can become sequential, so some of the performance comparison examples will not give you the correct numbers.

### Using Docker

Alternatively, you should get decent performance by running this Docker image on your own machine:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 fugueproject/tutorials:latest
```


## Jupyter Notebook Extension

There is an accompanying [notebook extension](https://pypi.org/project/fugue-jupyter/) for FugueSQL that lets users use the `%%fsql` cell magic. The extension also provides syntax highlighting for FugueSQL cells. It works for both classic notebook and Jupyter Lab. More details can be found in the [installation instructions](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue-jupyter#install).
