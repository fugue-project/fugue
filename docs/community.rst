==========

The Fugue project is not only about Fugue framework. The goal is to build the abstraction layer on
different computing and machine learning frameworks so that developers and scientists can focus more
on their own tasks and focus more on WHAT to do instead of HOW to do and WHERE to do. We have a very
diversed open source world, many frameworks are great only on certain things but they try to create
their own ecosystems excluding others. We believe that we deserve a more unified approach to distributed
computing and machine learning, and we deserve the freedom of choosing different options.
